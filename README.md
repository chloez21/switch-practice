Welcome to the **Metric Converter!**

Please input your query. For example, "1 km = m". 

Enter "exit" to exit the program

This little tool can do:
- km -> m
- km -> mile
- kg -> lb
- liter -> gallon
- celsius -> fahrenheit

If your input is not handled, the converter will say: 
"I don't know that, please give me something else"
